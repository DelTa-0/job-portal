# Job Portal Backend

A backend system for a **Job Portal application** built using **Node.js, Express, and TypeScript**. The project implements **role-based authentication and authorization**, allowing companies and applicants to interact with vacancies in a controlled and secure manner.

---

## Features

### Authentication & Authorization

* Role-based **Register & Login** system

  * Roles: `company`, `applicant`
* Secure authentication using JWT
* Protected routes based on user roles

### Company Features

* View all vacancies created by the company
* View applicants who have applied to a specific vacancy

### Applicant Features

* View available job vacancies
* Apply for job vacancies
* Upload profile image and CV during registration or application

### Email Verification

* Email verification implemented using **Node.js EventEmitter**
* Asynchronous email handling to avoid blocking the request lifecycle

### File Uploads

* File upload handled using **Multer**
* Supports:

  * Profile image upload
  * CV upload
* File type validation and storage configuration included

## Tech Stack

* **Node.js**
* **Express.js**
* **TypeScript**
* **PostgreSQL** (via ORM)
* **Multer** – file uploads
* **EventEmitter** – email verification events
* **JWT** – authentication
